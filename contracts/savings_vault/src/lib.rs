//! Savings Vault — Soroban smart contract for the PocketPay mobile wallet.
//!
//! Users deposit tokens, withdraw available funds, and lock funds with a
//! time-based unlock mechanism. Balances are tracked on-chain and all
//! state-changing operations require the user's authorization.
//!
//! # Emergency Pause
//!
//! The contract implements a time-bounded emergency pause model. When active,
//! `deposit` and `lock_funds` are blocked so no new funds can enter a
//! potentially compromised vault. Withdrawals (`withdraw`, `withdraw_lock`)
//! and all read-only helpers remain unaffected, ensuring users can always
//! exit. Only the stored admin can activate or deactivate a pause.
//!
//! See [`docs/pause-design.md`](../../docs/pause-design.md) for the full
//! design rationale and [`implementation.md`](../../implementation.md) for
//! the acceptance-criteria breakdown.
//!
//! See [`docs/state-machine.md`](../../docs/state-machine.md) for the
//! contract's state transitions and error paths.
